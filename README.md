# Pizza-Runer
Danny has launched Pizza Runner. He has prepared for us an entity relationship diagram of his database design but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runnerâ€™s operations.
This case study has LOTS of questions - they are broken up by area of focus including:
A.   Pizza Metrics
B.   Runner and Customer Experience
C.   Ingredient Optimisation
D.   Pricing and Ratings
